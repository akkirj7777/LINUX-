# LINUX-
ðŸ’» This is a LINUX learning journey documented as a learn-in-public approach, I hope it helps you.

âœ… I am avoiding documenting basic Linux commands like ls, history, whoami as it makes the process of learning repetitive and slow. I might add those commands later on.

ðŸ“¢ I believe that we cannot learn anything at its fullest. I am here as I want to keep track of learning and progress on my own. I am also learning from various sources and keeping everything in a place where anyone who needs it can get it without any friction.
